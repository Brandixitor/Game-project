Player plays as Homeless person in City in Ukraine/Russian vibe, one day Player Had Nightmare where he heard weird conversations
about some experiments, then he hears huge explosion, his heartbeat gets higher, he breathes really hard, then he hears people
screaming and runnning, then he wakes up, his heartbeat is still high, his blinks are really intense and he thinks it was all just
nightmare, but it wasn't, he starts to hear sirens, weird flyig almost alien like ships and he realises something is wrong,
he starts running, he finds out something went horribly wrong in research facility near city and alien invasion begins.
Player decides to go and try to somehow stop it, he can stole some kind of weapon from someone(something like Glock)
or he can go right into that facility and getting weapon there, when Player arrives to the facility he founds out
he is not the only one there, Army has begun their strike too, they are thinking that he is one of the scientists
so they need to kill him, here Player can go through few paths and that is, he can kill everyone from army, or not
this can change the story, this same can be with aliens and scientists. after Player begins to try and find what's
happening he discovers he have some sort of abillity, (unkown abillity from game dev side because we aren't decided yet)
that he can use to navigate through facility. There he finds out that they were doing experiments on people, and if that experiment
wasn't sucessful they wiped memory of that test subject and throw him out on the streets. lately they were doing experiment of giving
someone infinite knowledge, so they can then use it for themself, this experiment suceeded but, test subject decided to keep it for himself
because he knew if he would tell them it's working they would wipe his memory instantly, so he tricked them into thinking that itps not
working to keep testing on him. because he had infinite knowledge he created his own universe with alien creatures. after that he made huge
multi dimensional portal which brought his creature into our world, after that he started opening more portals across the city.
he wanted to escape so then he could start opening portals on the entire earth. When Player founds out about this he can decide to stop
the powerful human or he can just leave him and leave the entire facility. if Player decides to kill him he starts looking for his cell
but his cell was in top secret laboratories of this facility which were really long way, Player can decide if he wants to go through the facility
and old rails etc, or he can go up and o through the city, NOTE: each of this paths will have more sub paths which could change the story.
if Playr will go through facility, he will get to the point but it will be too late, That human was already in the city, but he found some papers
from one scientist who was part of this experiment, there were some notes of how it is done, and most importantly there were notes about
that if it will, there is something (this is also not done yet, we are not decided what it will be) that can slow him down alot, and it isn't even
that hard, he can decide to do it himself, or he can decide to go to the communications room where he will contact millitary to prepare that thing
that can stop him, then he will get to the city again, and there will be some epic boss battle, this is first ending, more Paths are not done yet
